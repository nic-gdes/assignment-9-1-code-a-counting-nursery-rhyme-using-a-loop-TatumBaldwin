        the actual lyrics:
    <p>    
        <div>
        Five green and speckled frogs
        Sitting on a speckled log
        Eating the most delicious bugs, yum, yum
        One jumped into the pool
        Where it was nice and cool
        Now there are just four speckled frogs, glub, glub
        </div>
        <div>
        Four green and speckled frogs
        Sitting on a speckled log
        Eating the most delicious bugs, yum, yum
        One jumped into the pool
        Where it was nice and cool
        Now there are just three speckled frogs, glub, glub
        </div>
        <div>
        Three green and speckled frogs
        Sitting on a speckled log
        Eating the most delicious bugs, yum, yum
        One jumped into the pool
        Where it was nice and cool
        Now there are just two speckled frogs, glub, glub
        </div>
        <div>
        Two green and speckled frogs
        Sitting on a speckled log
        Eating the most delicious bugs, yum, yum
        One jumped into the pool
        Where it was nice and cool
        </div>
        <div>
        Now there's only one speckled frog, glub, glub
        He jumped into the pool
        Where it was nice and cool
        Now there are no more speckled frogs
        </div>
    </p>
